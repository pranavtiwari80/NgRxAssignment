NgRx Store Assignment

In this, I have implemented a code to 

 - Retrieve a list of 50 coffees items from an endpoint
 - Implemented pagination, with a limit of 10 items per page
 
 - Data is managed via the NgRx Store
 - HTTP requests is being dispatched via NgRx Effects
 - The layout is responsive 
 - Used Tailwind framework
 - Also there is a design of product detail page.
 
 
 Just create clone of the the app and use the following
	npm install
